# This script installs the Python dependencies for the application firmware.

# Currently this takes a list of dependencies from the local requirements.txt file.
# In the future, we should pull in the dependencies from the application firmware repo.

# RPi OS prevents installation of system-wide Python packages with PIP.
# The recommended workflow is to create a virtual environment for the user, or use a venv for the project.
