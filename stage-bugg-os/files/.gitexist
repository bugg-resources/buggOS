# The /stage-bugg-os/files folder contains files that are copied directly into the build image.
# This file just keeps the folder in existence, for clarity when reading the repo
# The CI pipeline will clone repos into this folder, e.g., the application code repo, so it may be empty until the pipeline runs.
